# Introduction

When using Spotify, shuffling songs is essential for variety and avoiding repetition. There’s a feature to shuffle all songs by a single artist, which helps discover new tracks. However, I recently encountered an inconvenience: the inability to shuffle songs from multiple artists simultaneously. Although creating a playlist with all their songs and shuffling is a workaround, it’s time consuming and too much of a hassle. My goal for this project is to develop a plugin that allows user to seamless shuffle songs from multiple artists without needing to simple playlist
